# team-profile-generator

## Description:
This is a Node.js command-line application that was developed using the TDD (Test Driven Development) methodology. It uses Inquirer to take user inputed information about employees on a software team and generates an HTML webpage. This HTML webpage displays summaries for each person. The summaries of each employee can include: name, position, id, email, GitHub repo, school, and/or office number depending on position.

## Goals for the Project ( User-Story )

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## The acceptance Criteria

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
